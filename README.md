This repository contains scripts for the targeted assembly of complex genomic regions using singly unique nucleotide k-mers (SUNKs), or strings of length k that occur once in the genome. The scripts provided here use a SUNK library (i.e. generated with Jellyfish) and a set of ONT reads as input to barcode ONT reads and filter them based on shared SUNKs and their pairwise distances.
